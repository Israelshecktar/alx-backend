Pagination in REST API design is a technique used to divide a large set of data into smaller, more manageable chunks called "pages." This allows clients to retrieve data incrementally and helps improve the performance of the API by reducing the load on the server and the amount of data transferred over the network.

Here's a brief overview of how pagination works and some common methods used:

### Offset Pagination
This is the most straightforward method, where you use two parameters: `offset` (the starting point in the data set) and `limit` (the number of records to return). For example:
```
GET /items?limit=10&offset=30
```
This request would skip the first 30 items and return the next 10 items in the list¹.

### Cursor-based Pagination
Cursor-based pagination uses a pointer (the "cursor") to navigate through the data. It's more efficient for large datasets because it doesn't require scanning through all previous data to get to the starting point. A typical request might look like:
```
GET /items?cursor=abc123&limit=10
```
Here, `cursor=abc123` represents a unique identifier for the starting point of the page of data you want to retrieve².

### Keyset Pagination
Also known as "seek" pagination, this method uses the values of the last retrieved row to fetch the next set of rows. It's particularly useful when dealing with frequently changing datasets because it avoids issues like skipping or duplicating records that offset pagination might encounter.

### Best Practices
When implementing pagination, it's important to consider factors like the size of the dataset, performance requirements, and user experience. Some best practices include:
- Providing clear documentation on how pagination works in your API.
- Using consistent parameter names like `limit` and `offset` or `cursor`.
- Including metadata in the response, such as total number of records and number of pages, to help clients navigate the data.
- Ensuring that the pagination method chosen aligns with the nature of the data and the needs of the API consumers³.

Pagination is a crucial aspect of REST API design that, when done correctly, can greatly enhance the functionality and user experience of an API⁴.
